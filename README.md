todolist web app


In our everyday life to not only achieve our daily target but also to achieve big goals in our professional as well as personal life to-do list is very
important.Also to prioritise work and complete it in small chunks to-do list acts as a saviour.
In this application we can write all the task which we want to do and then checkmark them after which they get deleted from the list automatically. 
This application use MongoDB database for CRUD operations. I have used Mongoose to connect mongodb database and server. In the server side I have used 
Node.js and Express.js.
For Front-end I have used HTML and CSS.


I have used two  Azure services to build this application which are Azure App service and Azure Cosmos DB.
